[Tag Selector]: tag_selector.md

Add arbitrary key-value pairs to objects, just like in OpenStreetMap. This way, additional information can be stored, for example the height of certain features (for control descriptions). 

Tags will be imported from OSM and DXF files.

Objects can be selected based on their tags using the [Tag Selector].
