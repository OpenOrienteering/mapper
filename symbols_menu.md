#### Symbol set ID...

Opens a dialog for changing the map's symbol set ID.
The symbol set ID controls suggested symbol replacements during import and during explicit map symbol set replacement.


#### Scale all symbols...

This dialog can be used to re-scale all symbol dimensions. It is important to note that use of this feature will create a departure from the standard symbols and the resulting map will thus not conform to the standard.


#### Replace symbol set...

Shows the [symbol set replacement dialog](symbol_replace_dialog.md).


#### Load CRT file...

This action lets you select a [CRT file](crt_files.md) and replace symbols within the current map and symbol set.

#### Create symbol set report...

This action lets you export a detailed HTML report for the current map showing all colors and symbols.
