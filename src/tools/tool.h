 * A map editor tool uses mouse and key input to modify a map.
 * 
 * The given tool_button is unchecked when the tool is destroyed.
 * 
 * When deriving from MapEditorTool, do not make changes on the map editor or
 * window (e.g. status bar text) in the constructor. Another tool might still
 * be active at that point in time! Instead, reimplement the init() method.
 * 
 * This class provides a general but cumbersome interface. If you want to write
 * a simple tool and can live with some limitations, consider using
 * MapEditorToolBase instead.
