	 * OS X use the backspace key for deleting selected objects,
	 * while other platforms use the delete key.
	 * 
	 * This causes translation issues and inconsistent behaviour on OS X:
	 * - In Finder, moving an object to trash is Cmd+Backspace.
	 * - Other programs are reported to use [forward] delete.
	 * - Some programs are reported to support multiple keys,
	 *   e.g. Delete and Backspace.
	 * - A major source of irritation is the absence of a delete key on some
	 *   Macbooks. On these keyboards, delete is entered as Fn+Backspace.
	 * - Some programs use another key for delete, e.g. "x".
	 *   (Note that Cmd-x (aka Cut) will have a similar effect.)
	 * 
	 * \todo Either use a function for testing whether a key means
	 *       "delete object", or switch to a QAction based implementation
	 *       since QAction supports alternative QKeySequences.
