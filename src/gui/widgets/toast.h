/**
 * @brief A Toast displays a short message for a few seconds.
 * 
 * Toasts are initially hidden. Upon showText(), they show just the text.
 * Normally they do not offer any interaction. But they can display links
 * which will trigger the linkActivated() signal.
 * 
 * Toast does not use standard colors, but white text on a translucent dark
 * background when the regular background is bright, or black text on a
 * translucent bright background otherwise.
 * 
 * Toast shall be constructed with a parent widget. Then they will place
 * themselves at the bottom of the parents window upon show. Without a parent,
 * they will be treated as independent windows which may cause visual glitches
 * on some platforms, and the caller is responsible for positioning.
 * 
 * Due do the lack of interaction, the text shall be kept small, and the
 * timeout is limited to an implementation-defined maximum value (5000 ms
 * at the moment). A minimum value is enforced, too (500 ms at the moment.)
 * 
 * Synopsis:
 * 
 *    auto* toast = new Toast(parent);
 *    toast->showText("Hello world.", 1500);
 * 
 * \see QTooltip, Android Toast, QStatusBar::showMessage
