File format OCAD 6/7 (with preliminary information about OCAD 8)
====================

Version 14.2.01

General
-------

This is a description of the file format of OCAD 6 and OCAD 7 files. The
The OCAD 6 file format is completely different from the format of
OCAD 5 by the following reasons:

- Coordinates are 32-bit. This allow larger maps.
- The format is designed that objects or symbols can be
  appended at the end of the file. This was not possible in
  OCAD 5 where the entire file had to be rewritten when appending
  an object.

The OCAD 7 format is very similar to the OCAD 6 format. The main
difference is in the file header (section mark is 7 and version
is 7). For the new OCAD 7 features reserved bytes and bits have
been used. The symbol structures have the same size. However the
setup structure became bigger.
Here is a list of changes:
- TCord: one bit used for dash points in the y-coordinate
- File Header: section mark is 7, version is 7
- TColorSep: CMYK value for the color separation
  (reserved in OCAD 6)
- TLineSym: new variables Tool, FrColor, FrWidth, FrStyle
  (reserved in OCAD 6)
- TLTextSym: new variables Tool, FrWidth (reserved in OCAD 6)
- TAreaSym: new variable Tool (reserved in OCAD 6)
- TTextSym: new variable FrWidth (reserved in OCAD 6)
- TStp: new varialbles RealWorldCord, FileName, HatchAreas,
    HideTemp, TempMode, TempColor

The OCAD 8 format is still under development. However here are the
main changes. Note that there may be more changes during the
beta test. 
- File Header: section mark is 2 for normal files and 3 for
  course setting files, version is 8
- File Header: start of the first short index block. The short
  index blocks contains all data about course setting, database
  connection, templates (no longer in Stp) and some setup
  parameters. The description of the short index blocks does
  not yet exist.
- TIndex: Len now gives the number of coordinate pairs (nItem+nText)
  The maximum number or coordinate pairs has been increased
  to 32768. The length of an object in the file is now 32 + 8*Len.
- TElement: Poly is now array[0..32767] of TCord.


Be aware that this is an internal format and may change in future
versions. Instead of using the file format consider using one
of the export formats which are more constant and easier to
read:

- EPS (or AI in OCAD 7) for rendering the map in other systems.
- DXF for transferring the map information to GIS systems.

Data types used
---------------

OCAD is written in 32-bit Delphi and this description uses the
names for the data types as they appear in Delphi. However the
same data types are available in other development systems
like C++.

longint       32-bit signed integer
SmallInt      16-bit signed integer
WordBool      16-bit boolean
String[x]     Pascal-style string. The first byte contains
              the number of characters followed by the characters.
              The string is not zero-terminated. The maximum
              number of characters is x. It occupies
              x + 1 bytes in the file.
Double        64-bit floating point number
TCord         A special data type used for all coordinates.
              It is defined as

              TCord = record x, y: longint; end;

              The lowest 8 Bits are used to mark special points:
              Marks for the x-coordinate:
                1: this point is the first curve point
                2: this point is the second curve point
                4: for double lines: there is no left line
                   between this point and the next point
              Marks for y-coordinate:
                1: this point is a corner point
                2: this point is the first point of a hole in
                   an area
                4: for double lines: there is no right line
                   between this point and the next point
                8: OCAD 7 only: this point is a dash point
              The upper 24 bits contain the coordinate value
              measured in units of 0.01 mm

Note: all file positions are in bytes starting from the
beginning of the file.

File header
-----------
OCAD files start with a file header:

  TFileHeader = record
    OCADMark: SmallInt;        {3245 (hex 0cad)}
    SectionMark: SmallInt;     {OCAD 6: 0
                                OCAD 7: 7
                                OCAD 8: 2 for normal files
                                        3 for course setting files}
    Version: SmallInt;         {6 for OCAD 6, 7 for OCAD 7, 8 for OCAD 8}
    Subversion: SmallInt;      {number of subversion (0 for 6.00,
                               1 for 6.01 etc.)}
    FirstSymBlk: longint;      {file position of the first symbol
                               block}
    FirstIdxBlk: longint;      {file position of the first index
                               block}
    SetupPos: longint;         {file position of the setup record }
    SetupSize: longint;        {size (in bytes) of the setup record}
    InfoPos: longint;          {file position of the file
                               information. The file information is
                               stored as a zero-terminated string with
                               up to 32767 characters + terminating
                               zero}
    InfoSize: longint;         {size (in bytes) of the file
                               information}
    FirstShIndexBlk: longint;  {OCAD 8 only. This description does not
                               yet exist}
    Reserved2: longint;
    Reserved3: longint;
    Reserved4: longint;
  end;

The file header is followed by the Symbol Header:

  TSymHeader = record
    nColors: SmallInt;         {Number of colors defined}
    nColorSep: SmallInt;       {Number or color separations
                               defined}
    CyanFreq: SmallInt;        {Halftone frequency of the
                               Cyan color separation. This
                               is 10 times the value entered
                               in the CMYK Separations dialog
                               box.}
    CyanAng: SmallInt;         {Halftone angle of the cyan
                               color separation. This is 10 times
                               the value entered in the CMYK
                               separations dialog box.}
    MagentaFreq: SmallInt;     {dito for magenta}
    MagentaAng: SmallInt;      {dito for magenta}
    YellowFreq: SmallInt;      {dito for yellow}
    YellowAng: SmallInt;       {dito for yellow}
    BlackFreq: SmallInt;       {dito for black}
    BlackAng: SmallInt;        {dito for black}
    Res1: SmallInt;
    Res2: SmallInt;
    aColorInfo: array [0..255] of TColorInfo;
                               {the TColorInfo structure is
                               explained below}
    aColorSep: array [0..31] of TColorSep;
                               {the TColorSep structure is
                               explained below. Note that only
                               24 color separations are allowed.
                               The rest is reserved for future
                               use.}
  end;

The TColorInfo structure is defined as follows:

  TColorInfo = record
    ColorNum: SmallInt;        {Color number. This number is
                               used in the symbols when
                               referring a color.}
    Reserved: SmallInt;
    Color: TCmyk;              {Color value. The structure
                               is explained below.}
    ColorName: string[31];     {Description of the color}
    SepPercentage: array [0..31] of byte;
                               {Definition how the color
                               appears in the different spot
                               color separations.
                                 0..200: 2 times the separation
                                   percentage as it appears
                                   in the Color dialog box (to
                                   allow half percents)
                                 255: the color does not
                                   appear in the corresponding
                                   color separation (empty field
                                   in the color dialog box)}
  end;

Colors are defined as CMYK values:

  TCmyk = record
    cyan: byte;                {2 times the cyan value as it
                               appears in the Define Color dialog
                               box (to allow half percents)}
    magenta: byte;             {dito for magenta}
    yellow: byte;              {dito for yellow}
    black: byte;               {dito for black}
  end;

Spot color separations are defined as TColorSep structures. This
structure contains only general information about the color
separation. How the a specific color is rendered in
a color separation is defined in the TColorInfo structure.

  TColorSep = record
    SepName: string[15];       {Name of the color separation}
    Color: TCmyk;              {0 in OCAD 6, CMYK value of
                               the separation in OCAD 7.
                               This value is only used in
                               the AI (Adobe Illustrator) export}
    RasterFreq: SmallInt;      {10 times the halfton frequency
                               as it appears in the Color
                               Separation dialog box.}
    RasterAngle: SmallInt;     {10 times the halftone angle
                               as it appears in the Color
                               Separation dialog box.}
  end;

Symbol blocks
-------------
The file contains one or more symbols blocks. Each symbol block
lists the file positions of up to 256 symbols. The position of
the first symbol block is defined by the value FirstSymBlk in
the file header.

  TSymbolBlock = record
    NextBlock: longint;        {file position of the next symbol
                               block. 0 if this is the last
                               symbol block.}
    FilePos: array[0..255] of longint;
                               {file position of up to 256
                               symbols. 0 if there is no symbol
                               for this index.}
  end;

Symbols
-------
The different types of symbols are defined in different
structures. There is an abstract type TBaseSym, which
contains the fields common to all symbols types.
It is used for programming reasons, but does not exist
in real OCAD files.

  TBaseSym = record
    Size: SmallInt;            {Size of the symbol in bytes. This
                               depends on the type and the
                               number of subsymbols.}
    Sym: SmallInt;             {Symbol number. This is 10 times
                               the value which appears on the
                               screen (1010 for 101.0)}

                                 4: Text symbol

                               this symbol.
                               For a point object it tells
                               how far away from the coordinates
                               of the object anything of the
                               point symbol can appear.}

                               32 bytes, where each bit
                               represents 1 of the 256 colors.

                               are stored like the bits in a
                               Device Independent Bit Map (DIB).
                               The size of the bitmap is 22 by
                               22 pixels. Note that each line
                               has 12 bytes, because in a DIB
                               the size of each line must be
                               a multiple of 4 bytes.}
  end;

Points symbols are stored with this structure:

  TPointSym = record

                               the objects following this

                               The maximum value is 512}
    Reserved: SmallInt;
  end;

After this structure follow the objects which build that point
symbol. These objects are stored in the following structure.
Note that these objects are stored in a different way than
ordinary map objects.

  TSymElt = record

If there are several objects, they just follow each other (only
the coordinates used are stored). To determine the number of
objects the DataSize variable must be used.

Example for reading the symbols
-------------------------------

The following is a simple Delphi program to read all symbol
numbers and descriptions.

procedure ReadAllSym(const FileName: string);
var
  f: file;
  FileHeader: TFileHeader;
  SymbolBlock: TSymbolBlock;
  BaseSym: TBaseSym;
begin
  AssignFile(f, FileName);
  ResetFile(f);
  BlockRead(f, FileHeader, sizeof(TFileHeader));
  SymbolBlock.NextBlock := FileHeader.FirstSymBlk;
  while SymbolBlock.NextBlock > 0 do
  begin
    Seek(f, SymbolBlock.NextBlock);
    BlockRead(f, SymbolBlock, sizeof(TSymbolBlock));
    i := 0;
    while (i < 256) and (SymbolBlock.FilePos[i] > 0) do
    begin
      Seek(f, SymbolBlock.FilePos[i]);
      BlockRead(f, BaseSym, sizeof(TBaseSym));

      {read Sym and Description from TBaseSym}

      inc(i);
    end;
  end;
  CloseFile(f);
end;

Index Block
-----------
Each Index block contains the file position of 256 objects. In
addition it contains the symbol number and the extent (where on
the map the object is located) of each object.

  TIndexBlock = record
    NextBlock: longint;        {file position of the next block
                               0 if this is the last block}
    IndexArr: array[0..255] of TIndex;
                               {TIndex as defined below}
  end;

The position of the first index block is in the field FirstIdxBlk
of the file header.

  TIndex = record
    LowerLeft: TCord;          {lower left corner of
                               a rectangle covering the
                               entire object. All flag bits
                               are set to 0}
    UpperRight: TCord;         {upper right corner of
                               a rectangle covering the
                               entire object. All flag bits
                               are set to 0}
    Pos: longint;              {file position of the object}
    Len: word;                 {OCAD 6 and 7: size of the object in the file in bytes
                               OCAD 8: number of coordinate pairs, the size of the
                               object in the file is then calculated by: 32 + 8*Len
                               Note: this is reserved space in the file, the effective
                               length of the object may be shorter}
    Sym: SmallInt;             {10 times the symbol number
                               Deleted objects are marked with Sym=0}
  end;

For calculating LowerLeft and UpperRight the value Extent from
the corresponding symbol is added/subtracted to the outermost
coordinates of the object. The rectangle covers everything
which appears from the object.

Objects
-------
Objects are stored as a TElement structure.

  TElement = record
    Sym: SmallInt;             {10 times the symbol number}
    Otp: SmallInt;             {object type
                                 1: point object
                                 2: line or line text object
                                 3: area object
                                 4: unformatted text object
                                 5: formatted text object
                                    or rectangle object}
    nItem: SmallInt;           {number of coordinates in the
                               Poly array}
    nText: SmallInt;           {number or coordinates in the
                               Poly array used for storing text
                               nText is > 0 for
                                 - line text objects
                                 - unformatted text objects
                                 - formatted text objects
                               for all other objects it is 0}
    Ang: SmallInt;             {Angle, unit is 0.1 degrees
                               used for
                                 - point object
                                 - area objects with structure
                                 - unformatted and formatted
                                   text objects
                                 - rectangle objects}
    Res1: SmallInt;
    ResHeight: longint;        {reserved for future use to
                               store a height information}
    ResId: string[15];         {reserved for future use to
                               contain an ID for the connection
                               to a database}
    Poly: array[0..1999] of TCord; {OCAD 8: array[0..32767]    
                               coordinates of the object
                               followed by a zero-terminated
                               string if nText > 0
                               TCord is explained at the beginning
                               of this description}
  end;

Limits for nItem and nText in OCAD 6 and 7:
  nItem + nText <= 2000
  nText <= 1024 (8191 characters + terminating zero)
  The number of bytes of an object (as used in the TIndex
  structure) can be calculated as
    Index.Len := 32 + 8 * nItem + 8 * nText;

Limits for nItem and nText in OCAD 8:
  nItem + nText <= 32768
  nText <= 1024 (8191 characters + terminating zero)
  Index.Len := nItem+nText

Example for reading all objects
-------------------------------

The following is a simple Delphi program to read all objects.

procedure ReadAllObjects(const FileName: string);
var
  l: integer;
  f: file;
  FileHeader: TFileHeader;
  IndexBlock: TIndexBlock;
  Element: TElement; {"object" is a reserved word in Delphi}
begin
  AssignFile(f, FileName);
  ResetFile(f);
  BlockRead(f, FileHeader, sizeof(TFileHeader));
  IndexBlock.NextBlock := FileHeader.FirstIdxBlk;
  while IndexBlock.NextBlock > 0 do
  begin
    Seek(f, IndexBlock.NextBlock);
    BlockRead(f, IndexBlock, sizeof(TIndexBlock));
    for i := 0 to 255 do
      if (IndexBlock.IndexArr[i].Sym <> 0) {Sym is 0 for deleted
                                           objects}
        and (IndexBlock.IndexArr[i].Len > 32) then
      begin
        Seek(f, IndexBlock.IndexArr[i].Pos);
        l := IndexBlock.IndexArr[i].Len; {convert to 32 bits}
        if FileHeader.Version = 8 then BlockRead(f, Element, 32+8*l))
        else BlockRead(f, Element, l);

        {do something with the object}

      end;
  end;
  CloseFile(f);
end;

When appending objects check for
  IndexBlock.IndexArr[i].Len = 0
to see if there are any unused positions in this block. If all
positions are used, append a new block at the end of the file.

Setup
-----
The Setup structure contains miscellanous information about
the map. The file position of the Setup structure is given
in the field SetupPos in the file header. SetupSize gives
the size of the Setup structure in the file. SetupSize is
provided because additional fields may be added to this structure.
You may encounter files (created with a beta version) that
have a smaller size than defined below. Therefore when reading
the Setup structure
  - set the entire structure in memory to 0
  - read SetupSize bytes (but not more than sizeof(TSetup))
    from the file to the structure
If you want to save a Setup structure which is larger than
SetupSize in the FileHeader you have to append it at the end
of the file and adjust SetupPos and SetupSize.
